A WordPress plugin which slides a webpage over to reveal an additional interaction pane

== Description ==

If you've ever used the mobile version of Facebook, or Path,
then you've probably seen something akin to PageSlide in action.

Clicking on a button or link slides the page over to reveal a hidden pane,
one that usually contains secondary navigation, a form, or additional information.
